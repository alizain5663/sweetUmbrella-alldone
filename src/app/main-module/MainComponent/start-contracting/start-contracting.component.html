            <h2>Limited Company</h2> 
           <br>
           <p class="text-center">For many contractors, contracting through a limited company represents one of the most tax-efficient methods to be paid. Setting up your own limited company may be the most efficient way for you to work, whether you're just starting out as a contractor or freelancer or have been working for a while under an umbrella corporation. A limited firm can be formed in a variety of ways, but employing a professional contractor accountant can help you avoid some of the administrative problems and paperwork that come with running one. Learn about limited companies and why they may be the ideal contractor payroll solution for you.</p>

            <h2>PAYE Umbrella</h2> 
           <br>
           <p class="text-center">Using an umbrella corporation is the simplest way to get paid. It's simple to sign up for an umbrella company, and once you do, you're an employee of the umbrella company. With this payroll option, there is no need to establish up your own firm or deal with any administrative responsibilities other than submitting timesheets. Your umbrella payroll provider will manage all taxes, including income tax and national insurance. When you select this option, you will not be subject to IR35 restrictions. Umbrella enterprises, on the other hand, are not the most tax-efficient, and if you have the option of contracting through a limited company, you may be able to increase your net pay.</p>
